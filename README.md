# Simple Todo App (React + Tailwind CSS)

This is a **very simple and beginner-friendly Todo App** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The goal of this project is to understand the **basics of React state, input handling, and list rendering** — without complex logic.

## Project Structure

src/
├─ App.jsx
├─ main.jsx
├─ index.css

## How It Works

1. User types a todo in the input field
2. Clicking **Add** stores the todo in state
3. Todos are displayed using `.map()`
4. Edit and Delete buttons are present only for layout practice

This project intentionally avoids:
- IDs
- Reducers
- LocalStorage
- Complex patterns
